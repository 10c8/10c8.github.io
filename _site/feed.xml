*Risky task, isn’t it? Not as if they weren’t used to dealing with dangerous situations, no. But this one was different... People had all sorts of stories about that cave.*

*And once the night came, the brave Cinea Valens went on their mission.*

*— But did they beat the bad guys?*

*Calm down child, the story has only begun.*</content><author><name>10c8</name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">“My legion, your mission is to clear the cave east of Lunaren, in order to facilitate the advance of our troops on their way to Aaerdin.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">whois 10c8</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/08/29/whois-10c8/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="whois 10c8" /><published>2017-08-29T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2017-08-29T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/08/29/whois-10c8</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/08/29/whois-10c8/">I’m William Fernandes, a Software Engineer in the hot East Coast of Brazil.
