> “My legion, your mission is to clear the cave east of Lunaren, in order to facilitate the advance of our troops on their way to Aaerdin.”

*Risky task, isn’t it? Not as if they weren’t used to dealing with dangerous situations, no. But this one was different... People had all sorts of stories about that cave.*

*— Stories?*

*Yes. Some say this cave would emanate a faint yellow light on some nights, or how they could hear cracking noises coming from it from time to time.*

> “Go in, clear the area and leave as fast as possible. We don’t want to bring any attention, so you're doing this tonight. You should be done with it before the troops arrive this morning.”

*And once the night came, the brave Cinea Valens went on their mission.*

*— But did they beat the bad guys?*

*Calm down child, the story has only begun.*
