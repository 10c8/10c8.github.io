I’m William Fernandes, a hobbyist programmer, living in the hot East Coast of Brazil. I’m _enough to drink_ years old,
though I much prefer a good coffee over booze. I love music, soft/hardware engineering, emulators, making useless
projects and my girlfriend Laura (_emjrir_ :heart:).

Speaking of music, I sometimes dabble on making my own. You can check my stuff at my [SoundCloud][1] page.

This site is about my thoughts, projects and things that I find interesting in general. All in plain English
(hopefully).

You can check my stuff here and at my [Github][2].

Feel free to get in touch with me at `dev10c8 [at] gmail [dot] com`
