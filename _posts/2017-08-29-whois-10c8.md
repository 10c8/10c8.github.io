I’m William Fernandes, a Software Engineer in the hot East Coast of Brazil. I’m 19 years old and co-founder of [Natoken Entertainment][1], currently working on a MOBA game called [King’s Vessel][2] as Lead Programmer and Character Designer. I love coffee, soft/hardware engineering, emulators, and my girlfriend (:heart:).

This site is about my thoughts, projects and things that I find interesting in general. All in plain English (hopefully).

You can check my stuff here and at my [Github][3] profile.

Feel free to get in touch with me at `dev10c8 [at] gmail [dot] com`
